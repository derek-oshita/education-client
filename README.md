## Education Showwcase

Link to application: https://showwcase-challenge-client.herokuapp.com/

Education Showwcase had to be one of the most challenging yet rewarding projects I've ever done. After submitting a cover letter to the company, I quickly received an email about this challenge (props to Showwcase for the quick response). 

The purpose of the application was to emulate their software, specifically, the component responsible for adding educational credentials to a profile page. 

Requirements included the use of TypeScript and React TypeScript template, an auto-complete field on the "add-your-school" field via an API call, the ability to add as many posts as you want (reverse sorted in a sidebar on the left-hand side of the page), and a name field that could later be seeen in the "profile page."
